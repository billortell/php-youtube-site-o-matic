PHP-YouTube-Site-o-Matic
========================

Takes a YouTube username (and a couple other variables) and returns a whole video website with paginated lists, thumbnails, embeds, comments, and an RSS feed.

Basically, it's your YouTube profile with its own domain and CSS.

__Example:__ [tommyandthetommies.com](http://tommyandthetommies.com/)

Needs PHP5 and a YouTube username. Doesn't need a database or a YouTube API key.
